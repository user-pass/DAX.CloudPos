00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.000
In this video, we will see how the Workforce Management capability, 

2
00:00:03.000 --> 00:00:04.700
available in the point of sale, 

3
00:00:04.700 --> 00:00:07.200
empowers employees to optimize their work schedules,

4
00:00:07.200 --> 00:00:10.200
helping to reduce conflicts, improve efficiency,

5
00:00:10.200 --> 00:00:14.200
and ensure stores are adequately covered during peak sales periods.

6
00:00:17.200 --> 00:00:22.200
Alex, our store manager, wants to review the schedule for the next week before publishing it. 

7
00:00:22.200 --> 00:00:25.200
He realizes that the store is not adequately covered for Sunday

8
00:00:25.200 --> 00:00:27.200
and wants to add additional shifts.

9
00:00:27.200 --> 00:00:31.200
He adds an 8 AM to 5 PM shift for a worker named Ivo

10
00:00:31.200 --> 00:00:36.200
and adds notes requesting Ivo to open the store and clean the isles.

11
00:00:47.200 --> 00:00:51.400
The manager is now happy with the shifts and publishes the schedule for the next week.

12
00:00:51.400 --> 00:00:56.400
The store workers can now see the published the schedule in the point of sale.

13
00:01:08.400 --> 00:01:11.400
Aaron, a store associate, realizes that he has a 

14
00:01:11.400 --> 00:01:14.400
shift for this coming Saturday which he will not be able to make

15
00:01:14.400 --> 00:01:17.400
as he has a family commitment.

16
00:01:17.400 --> 00:01:22.400
Looking at the shift chart, he realizes that Ivo’s Sunday shift works well for him. 

17
00:01:22.400 --> 00:01:27.900
Aaron creates a shift swap request for his Saturday shift with Ivo’s Sunday shift.

18
00:01:27.900 --> 00:01:31.000
Unless Ivo accepts this request, the store manager will not

19
00:01:31.000 --> 00:01:34.000
be able to view the request and the schedule will not be updated

20
00:01:34.000 --> 00:01:37.000
until the store manager approves the swap.

21
00:02:07.000 --> 00:02:10.000
Ivo views the request in the point-of-sale 

22
00:02:10.000 --> 00:02:12.300
and excepts the swap request.

23
00:02:12.300 --> 00:02:17.300
Alex, the store manager, can now view the request and approve or deny it.

24
00:02:43.800 --> 00:02:46.500
Alex views the request and approves it.

25
00:02:46.500 --> 00:02:50.000
The schedule gets updated with the swapped shifts.

26
00:03:00.200 --> 00:03:03.400
Aaron also wants to take a vacation two weeks from today 

27
00:03:03.400 --> 00:03:05.400
and wants to request an absence. 

28
00:03:05.400 --> 00:03:10.400
He creates an absence request by selecting from the available absence codes.

29
00:03:36.900 --> 00:03:41.900
The absence requests are sent directly to the manager for approval. 

30
00:03:41.900 --> 00:03:44.900
Alex views the request and approves it. 

31
00:03:54.200 --> 00:03:58.800
The absence is now displayed on the schedule for the requested week. 

32
00:03:58.800 --> 00:04:03.800
Thank you for watching and please continue to the trial.
