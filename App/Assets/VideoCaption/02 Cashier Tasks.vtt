00:00:00.000 --> 00:00:03.300
 This video will walk through some of the common scenarios 

2
00:00:03.300 --> 00:00:06.000
undertaken by the cashier or sales associate. 

3
00:00:06.000 --> 00:00:09.200
This first scenario will walk through an assisted sale showcasing some 

4
00:00:09.200 --> 00:00:13.200
of the clientelling capabilities provided with the point-of-sale application. 

5
00:00:13.200 --> 00:00:16.700
Karen has come into our store and is looking to purchase an item from her wish list, 

6
00:00:16.700 --> 00:00:18.700
which she has added online earlier.

7
00:00:18.700 --> 00:00:21.900
We can find Karen within the system by scanning her loyalty card,

8
00:00:21.900 --> 00:00:25.900
or searching for her by her name, email address, or phone number.

9
00:00:29.900 --> 00:00:33.600
From here we can see her loyalty card and balance,

10
00:00:33.600 --> 00:00:38.600
recent purchases, product recommendations, and wish lists.

11
00:00:44.600 --> 00:00:48.600
Let’s add a product from her wish list to the sale now. 

12
00:01:01.600 --> 00:01:04.400
Within the transaction screen, we can see intelligent

13
00:01:04.400 --> 00:01:08.400
product recommendations, which we can offer to her.

14
00:01:10.400 --> 00:01:14.100
While she is in store, Karen wants to purchase a gift for her friend’s birthday.

15
00:01:14.100 --> 00:01:17.300
For this purchase, she has a specific price range in mind. 

16
00:01:17.300 --> 00:01:20.500
To accommodate this, we can browse the appropriate category, 

17
00:01:20.500 --> 00:01:22.500
in this case: accessories.

18
00:01:22.500 --> 00:01:25.000
Now we can refine results based on price 

19
00:01:25.000 --> 00:01:28.000
to find one that fits her budget.

20
00:01:40.000 --> 00:01:43.000
Here we can see a selection of items that will work for her. 

21
00:01:43.000 --> 00:01:46.200
At this point, we have the option to compare multiple product side-by-side 

22
00:01:46.200 --> 00:01:49.200
and add the appropriate one to the sale. 

23
00:01:55.200 --> 00:02:00.200
Karen has made a decision and is ready to make her purchase. 

24
00:02:09.200 --> 00:02:12.100
We take her payment and complete the transaction. 

25
00:02:12.100 --> 00:02:15.100
Since one of the items is a gift, Karen requests that we print a gift 

26
00:02:15.100 --> 00:02:19.600
receipt to give her friend in case she would like to return it for something else. 

27
00:02:19.600 --> 00:02:22.300
A week later, Karen’s friend comes back into the store 

28
00:02:22.300 --> 00:02:25.100
and would like to exchange the gloves for something different. 

29
00:02:25.100 --> 00:02:27.500
Returns are possible with or without a receipt. 

30
00:02:27.500 --> 00:02:30.000
In this case, we can scan the barcode on the gift receipt 

31
00:02:30.000 --> 00:02:33.000
and recall the transaction. 

32
00:02:35.000 --> 00:02:38.000
From here we can select the item to be returned

33
00:02:38.000 --> 00:02:41.000
and choose a return reason.

34
00:02:54.000 --> 00:02:56.700
Now we can add her preferred item to the sale. 

35
00:02:56.700 --> 00:03:01.700
As the item is more expensive, we collect additional payment and tender the sale. 

36
00:03:11.700 --> 00:03:14.700
Now let’s look at a different example, which will show some of 

37
00:03:14.700 --> 00:03:18.200
the special-order functionality within the point-of-sale application. 

38
00:03:18.200 --> 00:03:22.200
Karen comes in to the store and tells us she’s interested in a specific product.

39
00:03:26.200 --> 00:03:30.200
We checked inventory at our store and find that it is out of stock. 

40
00:03:36.200 --> 00:03:39.100
However, we see that there are some on order, 

41
00:03:39.100 --> 00:03:42.600
which are actually on their way to the store right now.

42
00:03:47.100 --> 00:03:49.400
Karen decides that she can wait for that item, 

43
00:03:49.400 --> 00:03:54.400
and so we will place an order now and have her pick up when the item comes in. 

44
00:04:32.400 --> 00:04:35.900
When she is in the store, she has selected two additional products.

45
00:04:35.900 --> 00:04:39.300
One of the items is in stock and she will take it with her today. 

46
00:04:39.300 --> 00:04:41.300
The other is in stock at a different location, 

47
00:04:41.300 --> 00:04:44.500
and she would like to have that item shipped directly to her. 

48
00:04:44.500 --> 00:04:48.300
In order to facilitate this, we will need to specify the shipping address, 

49
00:04:48.300 --> 00:04:51.000
shipping method, and additional charges. 

50
00:04:51.000 --> 00:04:55.000
We can now collect payment and tender the sale. 

51
00:04:56.500 --> 00:04:59.700
These are just a few examples of the routine functions

52
00:04:59.700 --> 00:05:02.200
available to cashiers within the point of sale.

53
00:05:02.200 --> 00:05:06.200
We hope you take the time to explore some of the additional capabilities within the trial.

54
00:05:06.200 --> 00:05:09.200
Thank you for watching.
